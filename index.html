      <p>
        Well now that you are 21, there are few things I want you to know baby;
        <br />
        I love you the most in the world, more than you could ever imagine.
        Before meeting you, I didn't know loving someone could be this
        beautiful. I fall in love with you every moment, every minute. Bae, I
        always wish you near me, always! I cry every time thinking about the
        distance between us. You know how much I love being near you, close to
        you, watching you. That's the best antidepressant pill, but on top of it
        the greatest thing in life is watching the love of your life achieving
        their dreams. I always, always want you to be happy Sahil because you
        deserve all of it. You have given me so much love, care, support, time,
        and so much more that I can't even count. Now it's my time, baby. You
        know we will always have each other's back, and I'm going nowhere. I'm
        always here whenever you need me and always rooting for your happiness
        because when you are happy, I'm the happiest. I love you, Sahil (Kaju),
        and I'm so proud of you.<br />
        LOVE, CHICA ❤️
